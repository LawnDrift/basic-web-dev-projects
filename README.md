# Projects Description
For this repository I'm going to be adding new basic projects to practice html, css, and javascript skills. Feel free to check them here!

This is a basic iphone UI style calculator that can perform the next operations: adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, changing to percent
and giving output to the screen. Totally functional.
